# Student Fees Management System
A web-based application for managing university student fees, built with Node.js, Express, and Supabase as a Storage as a Service (STaaS) solution. Deployed on Renderâ€™s free tier, this project allows admins to add students and record payments, while students can check their fee status (total, paid, and outstanding amounts). Supabase provides cloud-hosted PostgreSQL storage, demonstrating STaaS principles like scalability and accessibility.

## Features

- Add new students with details (ID, name, email, total fees).
- Record payments linked to existing students.
- View fee status for any student via a simple web interface.
- Error handling for invalid inputs or missing student records.
